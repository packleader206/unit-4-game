# Crystal Collector Game

## Overview

In this app, users try to exactly match a number randomly generated by the computer by clicking four different colored cystals.  Each crystal has a hidden value that is randomly generated at the start of each game, which will only be revealed when clicked. With each click, the crystal's value will be added to the user's total score. User wins if their total score matches the Target Number exactly, and lose if their total exceeds it.  A live demo of the app can be accessed [here.](https://packleader206.github.io/unit-4-game/)
